# Decentralized-Sim-Registration-System-Using-Blockchain-Technology
 
This system is a critical infrastructure project designed to create a secure, 
tamper-proof, and auditable SIM registration process by leveraging the 
immutability of a blockchain (Distributed Ledger) for record-keeping and linking 
it with a national biometric verification system. 
 
DIMS-SR's scope includes the development of a hybrid registration platform 
comprising: 
1. Mobile Client (Mobile App): For customer self-registration, identity 
initiation, and secure access using MFA. 
2. Application Server: The central component for business logic, 
communication with external APIs (NADRA/MNO), and logging. 
3. Blockchain Integration: Deployment of Smart Contracts and 
transaction submission to the Distributed Ledger for immutable record 
storage.
